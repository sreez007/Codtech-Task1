## Overview of the Project

### Project: Password Strength Checker

### Objective
This project aims to design and implement a password strength checker that evaluates user-inputted passwords against a set of security criteria, providing feedback on strength and suggesting improvements for weak passwords.

### Design Goals
1. Security: -Evaluate passwords against industry-standard security criteria (e.g., NIST guidelines).
             -Identify weak passwords and provide feedback for improvement.
             -Protect against common attacks (e.g., brute force, dictionary, rainbow table)
   
3. Usability: -Provide clear and concise feedback on password strength.
              -Offer suggestions for improving weak passwords.
              -Ensure ease of use for users of varying technical expertise
   
5. Accuracy: -Accurately assess password strength based on complexity and entropy
             -Minimize false positives and false negatives
   
7. Performance: -Efficiently evaluate passwords in real-time
                -Minimize latency and processing overhead
   
9. User Experience: -Provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface
                    -Offer customization options for security criteria and feedback
                    -Ensure accessibility for users with disabilities
